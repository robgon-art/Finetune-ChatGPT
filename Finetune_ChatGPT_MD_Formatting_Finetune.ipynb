During my investigation, I learned that three things are needed to create abstract paintings: (A) source images, (B) an ML model, and (C) a lot of time to train the model on a high-end GPU.

Their work led to research of both the biological processing in brains and the use of NNs for AI. Richard Nagyfi discusses the differences between Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and biological brains in this  post .

One of the key differences is that ANNs work with floating-point numbers and not just binary firing of neurons.  With ANNs it\\u2019s numbers in and numbers out.\\nThe diagram below shows the structure of a typical ANN. The inputs on the left are the numerical values that contain the incoming stimuli. The input layer is connected to one or more hidden layers that contain the memory of prior learning.

The system is trained with a dataset of input values and expected output values. The weights are initially set to random values. For the training process, the system runs through the training set multiple times, adjusting the weights to achieve the expected outputs. Eventually, the system will not only predict the outputs correctly from the training set, but it will also be able to predict outputs for unseen input values. This is the essence of Machine Learning (ML).  The intelligence is in the weights .

They came up with a way to train two ANNs that effectively compete with each other to create content like photos, songs, prose, and yes, paintings.  The first ANN is called the Generator and the second is called the Discriminator. The Generator is trying to create realistic output, in this case, a color painting. The Discriminator is trying to discern real paintings from the training set as opposed to fake paintings from the generator. Here\\u2019s what a GAN architecture looks like.\\nA series of random noise is fed into the Generator, which then uses its trained weights to generate the resultant output, in this case, a color image. The Discriminator is trained by alternating between processing real paintings, with an expected output of 1 and fake paintings, with an expected output of -1. After each painting is sent to the Discriminator, it sends back detailed feedback about why the painting is not real, and the Generator adjusts its weights with this new knowledge to try and do better the next time.  The two networks in the GAN are effectively trained together in an adversarial fashion . The Generator gets better at trying to pass off a fake image as real, and the Discriminator gets better at determining which input is real, and which is fake. Eventually, the Generator gets pretty good at generating realistic-looking images.

The system then checks for matching images in Wikimedia Commons [1] and the OpenImages dataset [2]. Both datasets have corresponding text descriptions of the images. I use the CLIP [3] encoders from OpenAI to first perform a semantic search on the text descriptions. A semantic search looks for matching concepts, not just a word search. I then perform a semantic search on the images. The user checks out the top 10 images that match the query and selects their favorite. Either the GPT-3 model from OpenAI [4] or the GPT-Neo model from EleutherAI [5] is used to generate 10 possible captions. The user selects the best caption to create the new meme, which can be downloaded.\\nMemes\\nThe Wiktionary defines the word  meme  as \\u201cany unit of cultural information, such as a practice or idea, that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another in a comparable way to the transmission of genes\\u201d [6]. The term originated in Richard Dawkins\\u2019 book \\u201cThe Selfish Gene\\u201d [7]. In the age of the Internet, the term meme has been narrowed to mean a piece of content, typically an image with a funny caption, that\\u2019s spread online via social media [8].\\nPrior Work\\nDylan Wenzlau created an automatic meme generator using a deep convolutional network [9].

I use OpenAI\\u2019s CLIP to perform a semantic search. The CLIP system accomplishes two functions, encoding both text and images into \\u201cembeddings\\u201d, which are strings of numbers that represent the gist of the original data. The CLIP model was pretrained on 40 million pairs of images with text labels such that the embeddings encoded from the images will be similar to the embeddings encoded from the text labels. For more information about how CLIP works, check out my article,  here .\\nWikimedia Commons\\nThe Wikimedia Commons has over 73 million JPEG files.

I use Goldsmith\\u2019s Wikipedia search API [10] to find the top 3 pages related to the text query and gather the image descriptions using the CommonsAPI on the Magnus Toolserver [11].

I then analyzed the topics using a combination of TSNE dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering to produce graphs using matplotlib.\\nHere are the most common topics according to the analysis. Note that similar topics are clustered together, and the size of the circles represents the number of occurrences in the song lyrics.\\n# System Components\\nThe following sections describe the components and processes I used in detail.\\n## Lyrics Database\\nFor the lyrics, I found a nice  dataset  by Anderson Neisse, an AI researcher in Brazil. The dataset has 128,083 songs from 2,940 bands in 6 genres. He released the dataset under the  Database Contents License .\\nAs I mentioned above, I filtered the list of songs with Rolling Stone Magazine\\u2019s list of the  100 greatest recording artists . The resulting list has 11,959 songs from 50 bands, including The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones, Chuck Berry, and Jimi Hendrix. In total, there are 185,003 lines of lyrics.\\n\"}]}\n",

For every 16x16 block of RGB pixels in the input, the decoder creates 256 floating-point numbers. So a 256x256 RGB image has a latent size of 16x16x256. The group of 256 numbers is called a \\u201ccodebook\\u201d in the VQGAN paper [4].\\nWhen I edit images in the latent vector space, the system will smooth out the results as it decodes the resultant image.\\nFor example, here are two portraits from the artists Gustav Klimt and Amedeo Modigliani. The top row shows the results of splicing the RGB images right down the middle. The left half is from Klimt, and the right half is from Modigliani. The bottom row shows the results of splicing the VQGAN latent vectors and decoding the resultant image.\\nThere are a couple of things to notice here. First, the VQGAN model is not a perfect codec. The images passed through the model do not match the original images exactly. For example, the eyes in the top-left and bottom-left portraits look different. However, you can see how splicing the images in the latent vector space blends the image parts quite naturally. Although the face in the center-bottom image is clearly made of two different halves, it\\u2019s hard to find the seam between the two. This is because each VQGAN codebook entry will not only render its spatial area when decoded, it will influence its neighbors to create a cohesive image based on the training data.\\nJul 7, 2022\\nE-DALL-E - https://medium.com/towards-data-science/e-dall-e-creating-digital-art-with-varying-aspect-ratios-5de260f4713d\\nI use this feature of VQGAN when rendering the sides of expanded images.\\nExpanding Images with E-DALL-E\\nHere is the component diagram again, showing only the processes used for expanding the image.\\nThe process starts with an input image and a specified aspect ratio. The system repeats the edge pixels to stretch the image, as described above. It then encodes the prompt using CLIP to guide the optimization process. For each iteration, the system encodes the image with CLIP. It uses the difference between the text encoding and the image encoding to modify the VQGAN latent vectors using the Adam Optimizer. After each iteration, the center part of the modified image vectors is replaced with the center of the vectors from the input image to keep the middle part relatively constant. Only the sides will change a lot. After N iterations, the system displays the final image with the new aspect ratio.\\nHere are some results from using E-DALL-E.\\nPretty good! The system seems to do a good job making up new details in the expanded areas. And it\\u2019s hard to see the seams between the original image and the newly generated parts. But you can also see how VQGAN sometimes changes the central part of the image to make the new pieces fit in better. For example, the sky's hue in the top-right image seems to have changed to a deeper blue in the central part. And the texture of the orange triangles in the center of the bottom-right image appears to match the surface of the newly generated triangles on the sides.\\nCultural Biases\\nLike most neural network models that were trained on large amounts of data found on the Internet, the models used in the project have inherent cultural biases that get picked up in the data.\\nThe CLIP authors studied the cultural biases that are present in their system.\\nCLIP is trained on text paired with images on the internet. These image-text pairs are unfiltered and uncurated and result in CLIP models learning many social biases. \\u2026 For example, we find that \\u2026 labels such as \\u2018nanny\\u2019 and \\u2018housekeeper\\u2019 start appearing for women whereas labels such as \\u2018prisoner\\u2019 and \\u2018mobster\\u2019 start appearing for men. \\u2026 Additionally, CLIP attached some labels that described high status occupations disproportionately more often to men such as \\u2018executive\\u2019 and \\u2018doctor\\u2019.  - Alec Radford, et al.\\nAnd the authors of DALL-E Mini found the following.\\nOverall it is difficult to investigate in much detail the model biases due to the low quality of generated people and faces, but it is nevertheless clear that biases are present. Occupations demonstrating higher levels of education (such as engineers, doctors or scientists) or high physical labor (such as in the construction industry) are mostly represented by white men. In contrast, nurses, secretaries or assistants are typically women, often white as well. Most of the people generated are white. It\\u2019s only on specific examples such as athletes that we will see different races, though most of them still under-represented. The dataset is limited to pictures with English descriptions, preventing text and images from non-English speaking cultures to be represented.  - Boris Dayma and Pedro Cuenca, et al.\\nE-DALL-E will likely perpetuate these biases when rendering the new parts of expanded images.\\nFinal Thoughts and Future Steps\\nThe results of the DALL-E Mini text-to-image model appear to be very good.

These image-text pairs are unfiltered and uncurated and result in CLIP models learning many social biases. \\u2026 For example, we find that \\u2026 labels such as \\u2018nanny\\u2019 and \\u2018housekeeper\\u2019 start appearing for women whereas labels such as \\u2018prisoner\\u2019 and \\u2018mobster\\u2019 start appearing for men. \\u2026 Additionally, CLIP attached some labels that described high status occupations disproportionately more often to men such as \\u2018executive\\u2019 and \\u2018doctor\\u2019.  - Alec Radford, et al.\\n\\n\\nAnd the authors of DALL-E Mini found the following.\\n> Overall it is difficult to investigate in much detail the model biases due to the low quality of generated people and faces, but it is nevertheless clear that biases are present. Occupations demonstrating higher levels of education (such as engineers, doctors or scientists) or high physical labor (such as in the construction industry) are mostly represented by white men. In contrast, nurses, secretaries or assistants are typically women, often white as well. Most of the people generated are white. It\\u2019s only on specific examples such as athletes that we will see different races, though most of them still under-represented. The dataset is limited to pictures with English descriptions, preventing text and images from non-English speaking cultures to be represented.  - Boris Dayma and Pedro Cuenca, et al.\\n\\n\\nE-DALL-E will likely perpetuate these biases when rendering the new parts of expanded images.\\n# Final Thoughts and Future Steps\\nThe results of the DALL-E Mini text-to-image model appear to be very good. And VQGAN is a versatile image rendering model with many unexpected uses, like expanding images to change the aspect ratio.\\n\"}]}\n",

I started by using the former to interactively create a title and plot summary for the new book. Then I used both systems to describe and draw an illustration for the cover. I edited the image and added typography myself using Photoshop. I then used ChatGPT to write the rest of the eight-page book and describe each image. I used it to create the prompts I fed into Midourney to generate the eight illustrations for the book. I used Photoshop to edit the images, add the text, and then assemble all the pages in Microsoft Word to create a PDF for the final book.\\nBelow are the details for each step. Note that I created the entire book using one ChatGPT session, which allowed context from previous interactions to inform the later responses.\\nGenerating the Title and Plot Summary\\nFrom my interaction with ChatGPT above, you saw that it knows the essential qualities of a good children\\u2019s picture book.

I kicked things off using a generic prompt, \\u201ccover of a picture book for children,\\u201d to see what it would create. I used the  /imagine  command in Discord and entered the prompt; about twenty seconds later, it generated four thumbnail images.\\nThe results were pretty good. The quality seems quite high, and the kids look adorable. The next thing I noticed, besides the flying whale and the creepy old man, was the random text. The current iteration of Midjourny, version four, is OK with generating text characters, but the words don\\u2019t make any sense. In the sections below, I discuss how I used Photoshop to add text to the images for the book. You can read more about using Midjourney in my earlier article  here .\\nNext, I\\u2019ll show how I used ChatGPT and Midjourny to create a new children\\u2019s picture book.\\n# Creating Picture Books with AI Systems\\nIn this section, I will walk you through my process for using ChaptGPT and Midjourney to create a children\\u2019s picture book. I started by using the former to interactively create a title and plot summary for the new book. Then I used both systems to describe and draw an illustration for the cover. I edited the image and added typography myself using Photoshop. I then used ChatGPT to write the rest of the eight-page book and describe each image. I used it to create the prompts I fed into Midourney to generate the eight illustrations for the book. I used Photoshop to edit the images, add the text, and then assemble all the pages in Microsoft Word to create a PDF for the final book.\\nBelow are the details for each step. Note that I created the entire book using one ChatGPT session, which allowed context from previous interactions to inform the later responses.\\n## Generating the Title and Plot Summary\\nFrom my interaction with ChatGPT above, you saw that it knows the essential qualities of a good children\\u2019s picture book. But the system just doesn\\u2019t know stuff; it can create stuff, too. I started by asking it to generate titles and plot summaries for the book.\\n> Create titles and plots for picture books for young children.\\n> \\u201cThe Brave Little Dragon\\u201d \\u2014 When a small dragon discovers that he can breathe fire just like his bigger dragon friends, he becomes the bravest dragon in the land and saves the day by using his fire-breathing skills to help those in need.\\n> \\u201cThe Great Garden Adventure\\u201d \\u2014 A group of friends set out on a journey through the garden, encountering all sorts of fun and surprising creatures along the way.

As a refresher, here is a GIF animation that shows one of his more famous photo series.\\nAnd here\\u2019s a portrait of Muybridge with an illustration of the apparatus he built to capture the photo series.\\nEadweard Muybridge\\nMuybridge was a nature photographer commissioned by the Governor of California, Leland Stanford, to document his mansion and possessions. Stanford posed an exciting challenge to Muybridge: could he take clear pictures of a galloping horse?\\n1872 was the year that Muybridge began his zealous involvement with motion photography. He was commissioned by Governor Leland Stanford to photograph the moving gait of his racehorse, Occident. Until this time the gait of a moving horse had been a mystery. When did the feet touch the ground? Did all four feet ever leave the ground at the same time? Painting the feet of the galloping horse had been an unsolved problem for artists. ... [He used] 12 cameras, each hooked to an electrical apparatus that would trip the shutters as the horse galloped past. \\u2026 Muybridge invented the zoopraxiscope in 1879, a machine that allowed him to project up to two hundred single images on a screen. In 1880 he gave his first presentation of projected moving pictures on a screen to a group at the California School of Fine Arts, thus becoming the father of motion pictures.- Vi Whitmire [1]\\nAnd Muybridge didn\\u2019t just take pictures of moving horses. He created similar sequences of moving cats, dogs, buffaloes, ostriches, people, etc.\\nMuybridge Derby\\nFor this project, I wanted to see if I could use AI systems to transform Muybridge\\u2019s animal locomotion photographs into high-resolution, full-color videos. After experimenting with various techniques, I changed the original sequences to be more realistic using a combination of  Midjourney  to create reference frames from text prompts and RunwayML\\u2019s Gen-1 Video Generator. For fun, I made a short animation, \\u201cMuybridge Derby,\\u201d showcasing the work. Here it is.\\nIn the following sections, I will describe how I transformed the locomotion sequences, generated the background scroll, and combined the elements to create the animation.\\nUsing Midjourney to Generate Reference Frames\\nAs a prerequisite for transforming a Muybridge photo series into a high-def video, I generated a high-resolution reference frame using one of the original series\\u2019s photos and a text prompt in Midjourney.\\nFor example, here is the prompt I used for generating the reference frame of the horse and jockey, \\u201c a man wearing a blue cap, blue jacket, white pants, and black boots riding a brown horse with a white background - -  ar 4:3 .\\u201d   Note that the --ar 4:3 parameter indicates the aspect ratio of 4:3.\\nI pasted in a link to the image of Muybridge\\u2019s frame number 2 along with the prompt into Midjourney, and it produced four thumbnail images. All four generated images were pretty good. I liked the details and texture of the images, including the look of the jockey\\u2019s clothes and the shininess of the horse\\u2019s coat. None of them matched the original pose of the horse exactly, but I found out that it doesn\\u2019t matter when stylizing a video. The video stylizer in RunwayML only picks up on the general look of the image. I chose the thumbnail image at the lower right (outlined in green) and made some edits in Photoshop; I flipped the image horizontally, changed the hue of the horse to brown, and changed the style of the jockey\\u2019s cap.\\nI repeated this process for the other four animals in the animation, a cat, a buffalo, an elephant, and an ostrich. Here are the results. You can see an image from one of Muybridge\\u2019s photo series in the left column below. The middle column shows the results from Midjourney using the Muybridge image and the text, like \\u201ca full-color photo of a cat running on a dirt track, side view, -- ar 4:3.\\u201d The selected thumbnail is outlined in green. The right column shows the selected image, cleaned up a bit and flipped horizontally if needed, in Photoshop.\\nThe Midjourney system did a great job generating the reference images. The details of the animals are amazing. You can click on any of the images to zoom in and see. Again, it didn\\u2019t precisely match the pose in the reference image, but the overall quality of the renderings was excellent.

During my investigation, I learned that three things are needed to create abstract paintings: (A) source images, (B) an ML model, and (C) a lot of time to train the model on a high-end GPU. Before I discuss my work, let’s take a look at some prior research.\\nThis is the first part of my series of articles on how AI can be used for creative endeavors. The second part is on how to use ML to generate plots for new stories, available  here .\\nBackground\\nArtificial Neural Networks\\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created a computational model for Neural Networks (NNs) back in 1943[1]. Their work led to research of both the biological processing in brains and the use of NNs for AI. Richard Nagyfi discusses the differences between Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and biological brains in this  post . He describes an apt analogy that I will summarize here:  ANNs are to brains as planes are to birds . Although the development of these technologies was inspired by biology, the actual implementations are very different!\\nBoth ANNs and biological brains learn from external stimuli to understand things and predict outcomes. One of the key differences is that ANNs work with floating-point numbers and not just binary firing of neurons.  With ANNs it’s numbers in and numbers out.\\nThe diagram below shows the structure of a typical ANN. The inputs on the left are the numerical values that contain the incoming stimuli. The input layer is connected to one or more hidden layers that contain the memory of prior learning. The output layer, in this case just one number, is connected to each of the nodes in the hidden layer.\\nEach of the internal arrows represents numerical weights that are used as multipliers to modify the numbers in the layers as they get processed in the network from left to right. The system is trained with a dataset of input values and expected output values. The weights are initially set to random values. For the training process, the system runs through the training set multiple times, adjusting the weights to achieve the expected outputs. Eventually, the system will not only predict the outputs correctly from the training set, but it will also be able to predict outputs for unseen input values. This is the essence of Machine Learning (ML).  The intelligence is in the weights . A more detailed discussion of the training process for ANNs can be found in Conor McDonald’s post,  here .\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks\\nIn 2014, Ian Goodfellow and seven coauthors at the Université de Montréal presented a  paper  on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)[2].  They came up with a way to train two ANNs that effectively compete with each other to create content like photos, songs, prose, and yes, paintings.  The first ANN is called the Generator and the second is called the Discriminator. The Generator is trying to create realistic output, in this case, a color painting. The Discriminator is trying to discern real paintings from the training set as opposed to fake paintings from the generator. Here’s what a GAN architecture looks like.\\nA series of random noise is fed into the Generator, which then uses its trained weights to generate the resultant output, in this case, a color image. The Discriminator is trained by alternating between processing real paintings, with an expected output of 1 and fake paintings, with an expected output of -1. After each painting is sent to the Discriminator, it sends back detailed feedback about why the painting is not real, and the Generator adjusts its weights with this new knowledge to try and do better the next time.  The two networks in the GAN are effectively trained together in an adversarial fashion . The Generator gets better at trying to pass off a fake image as real, and the Discriminator gets better at determining which input is real, and which is fake. Eventually, the Generator gets pretty good at generating realistic-looking images. You can read more about GANs, and the math they use, in Shweta Goyal’s post  here .\\nImproved GANs for Large Images\\nAlthough the basic GAN described above works well with small images (i.e. 64x64 pixels), there are issues with larger images (i.e. 1024x1024 pixels). The basic GAN architecture has difficulty converging on good results for large images due to the unstructured nature of the pixels. It can’t see the forest from the trees. Researchers at NVIDIA developed a series of improved methods that allow for the training of GANs with larger images. The first is called “ Progressive Growing of GANs ” [3].\\n'}\n",

Gonsalves\\nTowards Data Science\\nMay 10, 2023\\nGPT-4 Chords - https://medium.com/towards-data-science/writing-songs-with-gpt-4-part-2-chords-173cfda0e5a1\\nBackground on GPT-4\\nGPT-4 is the latest large language model from OpenAI. It is available using their  ChatGPT  user interface and accessed via their  API . The new model is available as part of a paid ChatGPT Plus subscription, which costs US$20 per month. As I noted in my last article, OpenAI will capture your inputs and responses which that might use to train future versions of their models. This is enabled by default, but you can opt out of data collection using their form  here .\\nThe responses from GPT-4 are notably better than the previous GPT-3.5 model. According to OpenAI’s  technical repor t, the new model scored 1,400 out of 1,600 on the SAT exams (710 for language, 690 for math), whereas the earlier model scored 1,260 (670, 590.)\\nDespite the excellent test scores, OpenAI reports that the output from the system is not always reliable and is not free from showing biases learned from the training data.\\nDespite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important. … GPT-4 can generate potentially harmful content. … It can represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the user’s intent, or of widely shared values. — OpenAI [1]\\nThis sounds scary and ominous. But for what I am doing in this project, generating chords for songs, the stakes are a lot lower.\\nUsing GPT-4 to Create Chords for Songs\\nIn my previous article, I asked GPT-4 to create lyrics for a rock song about cats and dogs. Here’s my first attempt to get the model to create chords for this song.\\nRobG: Write chords for the first verse of this rock song.\\nDogs and cats, they roam the streets Furry friends with hearts that beat Claws and paws, they rule the land Tails a-waggin’, they understand\\nSide by side, they chase the wind Bound together, best of friends They’re rockin’ in the moonlit night Dogs and cats, they’re out of sight\\nGPT-4: Here are the chords for the first verse of the song:\\nG C Dogs and cats, they roam the streets Em D Furry friends with hearts that beat G C Claws and paws, they rule the land Em D Tails a-waggin’, they understand\\nAm C Side by side, they chase the wind G D Bound together, best of friends G C They’re rockin’ in the moonlit night Em D Dogs and cats, they’re out of sight\\nThe chords seem pretty good, albeit a tad basic. Like most Large Language Models, GPT-4 was trained on lots of text from books and the Internet and it seems to have picked up on enough discussions about chords to generate decent sequences. I like the AABA structure of the progression: G — C — Em — D, G — C — Em — D,  Am  —  C  —  G  —  D,  G — C — Em — D.\\nHowever, there is an issue with text formatting. The chords don’t line up with the phrasing of the lyrics, i.e., the “D” chord should probably line up with “they’re” or “out” on the last line. I found an alternative approach that works fine: put the chords in line with the lyrics. I just had to ask.\\nRobG: Show the chords in line with the lyrics in square brackets separated by spaces.\\nGPT-4: [G] Dogs and cats, they [C] roam the streets [Em] Furry friends with [D] hearts that beat [G] Claws and paws, they [C] rule the land [Em] Tails a-waggin’, [D] they understand\\n[Am] Side by side, they [C] chase the wind [G] Bound together, [D] best of friends [G] They’re rockin’ in the [C] moonlit night [Em] Dogs and cats, they’re [D] out of sight\\nAh, much better. Having the D chord start before “out” for the last line makes sense because “they’re” is used as a pick-up note before the next chord starts.\\nIn addition to generating chord progression, GPT-4 also explains things related to music theory. So I occasionally asked it questions about the songs I was working on, like this.\\nRobG: What key is this in?\\nGPT-4:  The chords provided for the rock song are in the key of G major. The G major key consists of the following chords: G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), and F#dim (vii°).\\nThat seems correct. And I appreciated the full explanation of the chords used in the key of G major. Notice how it used both the letter names of the chords and the Roman numeral notation, where major chords are capitalized, i.e., (I), and minor chords are in lowercase, i.e., (ii.) I liked the way it used the ‘°’ character for the diminished chord.\\n'}\n",

According to OpenAI’s  technical repor t, the new model scored 1,400 out of 1,600 on the SAT exams (710 for language, 690 for math), whereas the earlier model scored 1,260 (670, 590.)\\nDespite the excellent test scores, OpenAI reports that the output from the system is not always reliable and is not free from showing biases learned from the training data.\\n> Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from “hallucinations”), has a limited context window, and does not learn. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important. … GPT-4 can generate potentially harmful content. … It can represent various societal biases and worldviews that may not be representative of the user’s intent, or of widely shared values. — OpenAI [1]\\n\\n\\nThis sounds scary and ominous. But for what I am doing in this project, generating chords for songs, the stakes are a lot lower.\\n# Using GPT-4 to Create Chords for Songs\\nIn my previous article, I asked GPT-4 to create lyrics for a rock song about cats and dogs. Here’s my first attempt to get the model to create chords for this song.\\n> RobG: Write chords for the first verse of this rock song.\\n> Dogs and cats, they roam the streets Furry friends with hearts that beat Claws and paws, they rule the land Tails a-waggin’, they understand\\n> Side by side, they chase the wind Bound together, best of friends They’re rockin’ in the moonlit night Dogs and cats, they’re out of sight\\n> GPT-4: Here are the chords for the first verse of the song:\\n> G C Dogs and cats, they roam the streets Em D Furry friends with hearts that beat G C Claws and paws, they rule the land Em D Tails a-waggin’, they understand\\n> Am C Side by side, they chase the wind G D Bound together, best of friends G C They’re rockin’ in the moonlit night Em D Dogs and cats, they’re out of sight\\n\\n\\nThe chords seem pretty good, albeit a tad basic. Like most Large Language Models, GPT-4 was trained on lots of text from books and the Internet and it seems to have picked up on enough discussions about chords to generate decent sequences. I like the AABA structure of the progression: G — C — Em — D, G — C — Em — D,  Am  —  C  —  G  —  D,  G — C — Em — D.\\nHowever, there is an issue with text formatting. The chords don’t line up with the phrasing of the lyrics, i.e., the “D” chord should probably line up with “they’re” or “out” on the last line. I found an alternative approach that works fine: put the chords in line with the lyrics. I just had to ask.\\n> RobG: Show the chords in line with the lyrics in square brackets separated by spaces.\\n> GPT-4: [G] Dogs and cats, they [C] roam the streets [Em] Furry friends with [D] hearts that beat [G] Claws and paws, they [C] rule the land [Em] Tails a-waggin’, [D] they understand\\n> [Am] Side by side, they [C] chase the wind [G] Bound together, [D] best of friends [G] They’re rockin’ in the [C] moonlit night [Em] Dogs and cats, they’re [D] out of sight\\n\\n\\nAh, much better. Having the D chord start before “out” for the last line makes sense because “they’re” is used as a pick-up note before the next chord starts.\\nIn addition to generating chord progression, GPT-4 also explains things related to music theory. So I occasionally asked it questions about the songs I was working on, like this.\\n> RobG: What key is this in?\\n> GPT-4:  The chords provided for the rock song are in the key of G major. The G major key consists of the following chords: G (I), Am (ii), Bm (iii), C (IV), D (V), Em (vi), and F#dim (vii°).\\n\\n\\nThat seems correct. And I appreciated the full explanation of the chords used in the key of G major. Notice how it used both the letter names of the chords and the Roman numeral notation, where major chords are capitalized, i.e., (I), and minor chords are in lowercase, i.e., (ii.) I liked the way it used the ‘°’ character for the diminished chord.\\n'}\n",
